# Part 5: Parametrized Tests
* The [`pytest.mark.parametrize`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/how-to/parametrize.html) decorator iterates tests over pairs of inputs and outputs
* Easy to add additional edge cases to test suites
* This feature lends itself well to Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  * **Test-Driven Development**: a software development methodology in which tests are written before the actual code implementation.
